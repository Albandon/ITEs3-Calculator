# About project:
This project was also a part of an assigment which to put simply had its main objective to teach us about how does computer arithmetic work. 

As out task we had to make a working calculator which would be able to perform operations such as ``Addition``, ``Subtraction``, ``Multiplication`` and ``Division`` inside any possible number base possible.
To make it a bit simpler we could implement such operations only on **natural numbers** which limited us only to non-negative integers.  

And so its able to perform those operations in number bases from ``2`` (bin) up to ``16`` (hex).

Calculator after some additional work outside the assigment is able to operate on any integer values.
# Current State:
Currently, calculator isn't able to perform division and has some bugs with the printing of some values.
Another thing to mention some operations aren't really optimized and need some reworking. It is for now working only inside terminal console.
# Future Plans:
- Actual application
- Optimised division
- Optimizations
- modulus operation
